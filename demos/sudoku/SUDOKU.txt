PRINCIPLE:

* an animated sudoku solver with backgound colors representing the number of options that are available
* combined with a non-trivial backtracking alorithm this should result in a lot of dancing colors ;-)

ideas
-----
* investigate different algorithms and compare there relative performance
  * improve current algorithm using arc-consistency (see CSP chapter in AIMA)
  * local search

* a GUI for input of numbers
