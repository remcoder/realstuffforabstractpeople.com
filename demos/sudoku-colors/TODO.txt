TODO

- the text-shadow animation in the title makes everything very slow in FF and on the Nexus
	- we can try not animating the textshadow property and using an extra element for the glow.
	  that way the text-shadow can be static and we can animate using opacity alone
- on the ipad the variable numbers are not centered
- on the Nexus there is an initial sluggishness when the solution is animated.
- the sudoku not precisely centered
- I broke cursor going to the next cell
